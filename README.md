# BigchainGUI
Python GUI to start BigchainDB and load test transactions. 

# Prerequisites: 

Works on Ubuntu 15.04 (Should work will all Linux distributions). 

*** You might have to alter the script as Bigchain gets developed, for example loading test transactions used to be done by using the command 'bigchaindb-benchmark load' which got replaced by 'bigchaindb load'. I will try to keep this updated. ***

1. Must have RethinkDB installed.
2. Must have BigchainDB installed. 
3. Python3 

# To Run:
1. Go to working directory - cd path/to/BigchainGUI.py
2. Run the script - python3 BigchainGUI.py
